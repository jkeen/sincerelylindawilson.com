Dear Mr. Hasbro,

My daughter, Denise, was given the easy bake oven as a birthday gift recently and last weekend I decided to put it to good use. I attempted to make my famous chicken kiev dish, but after sitting down to eat it my family realized the chicken was grossly undercooked. My youngest son, Aaron, stayed up vomiting all night as a result. Is this normal? I couldn't find any solution in the FAQ for this problem. Is my easy bake oven defective? If so, how do I get a replacement?

Sincerely,  
Linda B Wilson

P.S. Can I get the unit in blue?
