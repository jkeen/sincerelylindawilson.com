Dear Glad,

Recently my family and I organized a neighborhood cleanup after our neighbor's house was vandalized by a local gang. We chose to use your Force Flex bags to gather up the debris because of the highly-acclaimed "puncture protection" your brand offers, while other brands do not.

Surprisingly, the shards of broken glass and several boards with nails were no match for these bags. I was disappointed and embarrassed that the bags I publicly supported broke and spilled their contents in front of all my neighbors.

I was wondering if the bags I purchased are defective, or if Iâ€™m using them incorrectly? Should I have double bagged? Do you have a product that is designed to withstand greater force?

Sincerely,  
Linda B. Wilson
