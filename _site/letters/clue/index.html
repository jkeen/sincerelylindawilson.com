            <p>Dear Parker Brothers,</p>

<p>Last Sunday I caught my youngest son, Aaron, playing Clue with his friends in our rumpus room after I had finished cleaning up after his birthday party. I loved playing Clue as a child, so when Aaron had some questions about the gameplay, I was happy to assist. While paging through the rulebook, I noticed that the listed age range was "8 and up", which brings me to the reason for this letter. My son is six, and his friends range from the age of five and a half to seven. I'm afraid the violent nature of the game may be damaging to children younger than the recommended age range. What changes should I watch for in my son to assure he hasn't been affected by this game? What experiences have other customers had?</p>

<p>I haven't broken the news to his friends' parents yet, as I thought I would consult with you first. Needless to say, I have confiscated the game, and will only allow him to play it when he has reached the age of eight.</p>

<p>Have you thought about creating a Clue-type game more appropriate for young children? How about a game where you have to solve who threw the surprise party in what room, and using what party favor? The options could be streamers, party hats, kazoos, and balloons. You could even reuse the same game board.</p>

<p>Also, do you have any recommendations for currently available board games more appropriate for a six year old?</p>

<p>Sincerely,  <br/>
Linda Wilson</p>

            <p>Dear Stephanie,</p>

<p>Thank you for you response.  I am interested in finding a more appropriate game for my son to play, but am concerned that "Clue Carnival: The Case Of The Missing Prizes" might encourage stealing, as the original clue seems to have encouraged some violent tendencies in my young son.</p>

<p>Recently he started playing an incredibly violent game on his Wii called "Chicken Shooter", which features execution-style slaughterings of innocent animals. To make matters worse, I found a dead chicken in our chicken coop yesterday, and I can't help but suspect Aaron. Is this normal?</p>

<p>I appreciate the offer to exchange my copy of Clue.  Do you think the game could be modified in the next two years to be more appropriate for younger children?  If not, I may as well keep my current copy and only bring it out again when Aaron is at an appropriate age to handle the mature content.</p>

<p>Sincerely,  <br/>
Linda Wilson</p>

<p>P.S. Would you please forward my original email to your game developers?  I believe there is some value in the surprise party version of Clue I described.  I started creating my own version at home, but have had trouble finding a miniature kazoo for one of the game pieces. Perhaps your developers might be able to suggest an appropriate place to purchase such things.</p>
