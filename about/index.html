  <h4>The Writers</h4>
  <p>
    <a href="http://keen.me">Jeff Keen</a> and Sam Lawrence have been writing letters under the guise of Linda Wilson since 2002. They certainly didn't expect to still be doing it a decade later, but here they areâ€”two thirty-something men writing as a naive, forty-something woman.

  <h4>The Character, Linda Wilson</h4>
  <p>
    Linda Wilson is a <a href="/letters/force-flex-trash-bags">good hearted</a> 44 year old, who lives with her husband and two children somewhere in the midwestern United States.  She often <a href="/letters/free-whitepaper">misunderstands</a> a <a href="/letters/brookstone-gas-grill-cover">product&#8217;s intended use</a>, takes <a href="/letters/tempur-pedic">suggestions from advertisements</a> literally, and always lacks the <a href="/letters/easy-bake-oven">common sense</a> most of us take for granted.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Linda Wilson was a real person, she would have died at an early age.
