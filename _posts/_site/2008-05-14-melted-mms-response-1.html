<p>Thank you for your email.</p>

<p>Our advertising slogan actually reads; &#8220;THE MILK CHOCOLATE MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH-NOT IN YOUR HANDS.&#8221; The objective of our advertising is to acquaint consumers with the fact that the candies are neat to eat under average conditions because they have a thin sugar shell protecting the chocolate centers.</p>

<p>We believe that the &#8220;melting&#8221; you described pertains to the sugar shell coating of the candies. Sometimes the pure food colors will rub off when they come in contact with moisture in the hands &#8211; especially if the candy is held for a while.</p>

<p>Have a great day!</p>
