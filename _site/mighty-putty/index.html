<p>Dear Mighty Putty,</p>

<p>I have great memories of playing with your putty as a child, so when I saw your product in the store the other day, I bought it for my son, Aaron.</p>

<p>I used to find transferring Archie comics particularly enjoyable, so I pulled out my husband's vintage newspaper comic collection to demonstrate.  Unfortunately, my demonstration failed and resulted in a ripped newspaper, a disappointed son, and an extremely angry husband.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I received a defective product, or if I'm doing something incorrectly?  I noticed that this putty no longer comes in a plastic egg, and am wondering if that somehow affected the shelf life.</p>

<p>Also, do you know where I can get a copy of the June, 4th, 1967 Chicago Tribune printing of Archie?  It's the one where Jughead enters an eating contest.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Linda Wilson</p>
