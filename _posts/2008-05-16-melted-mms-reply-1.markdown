Dear M&Ms,

Thank you for your speedy response, but I fear that you have misunderstood my problem.  The M&Ms in question were not in my hand at the time, but in my back pocket.

I don't think the candy shell melted, either, it just cracked and let the melted chocolate ooze out, staining my favorite pair of desert survival pants.

While I now see that your melting guarantee doesn't cover the candies while not in hands or mouths, I'm concerned that other customers might make the same mistake, causing them to have an unfortunate experience similar to mine. 

Would it be possible to put a warning on future bags of M&Ms warning customers that severe melting could occur if kept in pants pockets for extended periods of time?

Sincerely,  
Linda B. Wilson

P.S. Do Peanut M&Ms suffer from the same problems as the plain variety?
