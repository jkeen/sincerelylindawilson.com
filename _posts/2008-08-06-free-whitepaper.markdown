Dear CDW,

I recently saw your online advertisement for "free whitepaper" while I was browsing for a birthday present for my husband, and was intruiged.  Not being one to pass up a good deal, I clicked on the link and printed out the suggested files.  To my surprise, when the paper came out of my printer it already had writing on it.  Was this an error on my part, or is your link incorrect?  I was expecting plain white paper.

Sincerely, 
Linda B Wilson

P.S.  Do you offer free colored paper, too?  I'm doing an art project and am in need of some colorful paper. Neon green, specifically.
