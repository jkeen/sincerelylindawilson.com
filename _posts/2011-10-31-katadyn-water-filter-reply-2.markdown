Dear Alan, 

I think I owe you an apology. I misunderstood your previous email, and assumed Katadyn would be flying my family to Switzerland for testing. I'm embarrassed to admit that I already started packing and learning the language. My daughter was excited to visit IKEA headquarters, too. This news will be disappointing to my whole family.

What kind of questions will you need to ask my son? He is a very curious eight year old, and I'm sure he will be excited to talk to someone from another country.

I understand your need to get more information on this matter, and appreciate your persistence. I referred to my husband's expert diagnosis in a previous email, is there other documentation that he should provide? He could write something up using official university letterhead describing Aaron's symptoms, if that would help.

Again, I'm so sorry about the travel misunderstanding. Or as the Swedish say, SÃ¥ lessen!

Sincerely,  
Linda B. Wilson
