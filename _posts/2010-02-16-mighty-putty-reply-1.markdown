Oh dear, that is very disappointing to hear, but makes sense now that I think about it.  When I left it out on the counter, my son kept playing with it and tried making impressions of my car keys. I called him away to help me clean up his room, and when I came back the putty had hardened around the car keys.  Do you know how I can remove it?  I can't start my car, and I have an appointment I need to be getting to soon.

Do you still sell the silly variety of your putty?
