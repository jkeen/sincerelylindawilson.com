      <p>Dear Jazzercise,</p>

<p>I've gained some weight recently since I started trying to save money
and buy food in bulk though Sam's Club. While those bulk packages of
bagel bites and half-gallon tubs of creme cheese are a great value,
it's a lot to eat!</p>

<p>After I turned 40 a couple of weeks ago, I decided I needed to shed
some pounds, so I started looking for ways to get some rigorous
exercise in a sustainable and fun way. My friend Mary Inskeep
recommended Jazzercise, because she knows I'm a music fan.</p>

<p>I recently attended one of your workout courses, and while I found the
exercise rigorous enough for my liking, I was extremely disappointed
in the lack of real jazz music that was played. I was expecting hits
by Yanni, Kenny G, Zamfir, and Enya, but was instead forced to listen
to songs that reminded me of the time I was looking for an art show
and accidentally wandered into Studio 54.</p>

<p>Do you offer any classes where actual authentic jazz music is played?</p>

<p>Thank you,
Linda Wilson</p>

<p>I was searching for someone reliable to carry my bags for my upcoming trip to Branson, Missouri, and came across your web site. However, it seems your site has been "hacked" and taken over by some sort of college newspaper.</p>

<p>I was hoping to hire a good porter, as I will have to move between multiple hotels during my five night stay in Branson.</p>

<p>Do you still offer porter services, or have you shut down?</p>

      <p>Dear Katadyn,</p>

<p>I have recently become concerned over the impurities in public drinking water, and did research on the most environmentally friendly microfilter I could use to protect my children from bacterial dangers. I recently purchased one of your Hiker model Katadyn microfilters and was very excited to start being more environmentally conscious, while at the same time enjoying natural and pure water.</p>

<p>My youngest son, Aaron, went on a class field trip to the stockyards in Milwaukee last week, and I sent him off with our new water filter in his lunch sack, along with a sandwich and a fruit rollup. During the lunch break, Aaron found some water that had collected on the ground, and filtered it using the water filter. To my astonishment, he became violently ill later that night, and was so sick the next day that he missed the Science Fair. Aaron was very upset, because he had worked awfully hard on his project on bacterial growth, and no one got to see the bacterial colonies that he grew from a culture.</p>

<p>Is it possible that we received a contaminated outlet hose from the factory? I noticed on the unit that it said "made in Sweden", and I have a Swedish friend who never washes her hands after using the lavatory. Have your other customers had similar problems with this unit?</p>

      <p>Dear Parker Brothers,</p>

<p>Last Sunday I caught my youngest son, Aaron, playing Clue with his friends in our rumpus room after I had finished cleaning up after his birthday party. I loved playing Clue as a child, so when Aaron had some questions about the gameplay, I was happy to assist. While paging through the rulebook, I noticed that the listed age range was "8 and up", which brings me to the reason for this letter. My son is six, and his friends range from the age of five and a half to seven. I'm afraid the violent nature of the game may be damaging to children younger than the recommended age range. What changes should I watch for in my son to assure he hasn't been affected by this game? What experiences have other customers had?</p>

<p>I haven't broken the news to his friends' parents yet, as I thought I would consult with you first. Needless to say, I have confiscated the game, and will only allow him to play it when he has reached the age of eight.</p>

<p>Have you thought about creating a Clue-type game more appropriate for young children? How about a game where you have to solve who threw the surprise party in what room, and using what party favor? The options could be streamers, party hats, kazoos, and balloons. You could even reuse the same game board.</p>

<p>Also, do you have any recommendations for currently available board games more appropriate for a six year old?</p>

<p>I have great memories of playing with your putty as a child, so when I saw your product in the store the other day, I bought it for my son, Aaron.</p>

<p>I used to find transferring Archie comics particularly enjoyable, so I pulled out my husband's vintage newspaper comic collection to demonstrate.  Unfortunately, my demonstration failed and resulted in a ripped newspaper, a disappointed son, and an extremely angry husband.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I received a defective product, or if I'm doing something incorrectly?  I noticed that this putty no longer comes in a plastic egg, and am wondering if that somehow affected the shelf life.</p>

<p>Also, do you know where I can get a copy of the June, 4th, 1967 Chicago Tribune printing of Archie?  It's the one where Jughead enters an eating contest.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday was my birthday, and a few friends and I went out to a local pizza parlor to celebrate.  I ate several slices of pizza, making sure to track my points. I indulged, and had about 20 points worth of pizza, causing me to have to dip into my flex points.  Later that night I didn't feel well, and eventually threw up my dinner.</p>

<p>How does this affect my points?  Do I get those 20 points back? Does it depend on how much I threw up?  Because if so, I threw up about 1 and 3/4 cups.</p>

<p>I recently rented some movies from you over the weekend and saw a disturbing FBI message at the beginning of one of the films: "DVD FOR SALE ONLY".  I do not want to get in trouble with the FBI, as I have had some tax problems in the past, and do not want to press my luck.  What do I need to do to safely resolve this situation?  Can I purchase the film in question from you for the original cost minus the cost of the rental (which I already paid)?  Will that be enough to keep me out of trouble?</p>

<p>Also, are you going to get in trouble from the government for renting a DVD that's clearly meant for sale only, or did you simply mix up DVDs you had for sale and DVDs you had for rent?  For what it's worth, I will not say anything to the FBI about this matter, as I enjoy your video store very much and would not want to see it closed down.</p>

      <p>Dear M&amp;Ms,</p>

<p>I once saw a commercial that claimed that your candy only melted inside mouths, so when I was searching for snacks for my recent desert survival retreat, I chose M&amp;Ms.  On our trip, I slipped a handful of your candies into my back pocket to keep myself energized for our long hike, but after a few hours my hike-mates started giving me strange looks, often asking if I was feeling all right.  I realized what they were thinking later, when I discovered that the candies had melted completely, leaving a suspicious brown stain on my rear end.  Needless to say, I was mortified.</p>

<p>My attempts to keep the candies cool by putting them inside our water jug were fruitless, as they eventually dissolved and contaminated the jug.  Later, when my hike-mate left her jug of water at our previous campsite, we had to rely on the melted M&amp;M tainted drinking water for our primary water source.  Unfortunately, the sugary water dried us all out more than aided us, and some of us suffered the ill effects of severe dehydration.  We ended up having to cut our trip short, due to this.</p>

<p>Is this normal?   I am wondering if you might have a candy that withstands greater temperatures, or if I just received a defective bag of M&amp;Ms?  Would skittles have been a better desert snack?</p>

I have tried several different brands of ice cream with no luck -- the chips simply will not scoop satisfactorily.  Would you recommend a different product for this purpose, or do you think the problem is with the ice cream I'm using?

<p>I recently purchased your Rectangular Gas Grill Cover to protect my new Weber grill, and while I am pleased with the overall look of the cover, I have had some trouble using it while grilling.  Although it fits snugly when the grill is closed, opening the grill is difficult while the cover is in place.  I managed to prevent it from slipping by fastening it more securely to the grill with some duct tape, but I do feel a better attachment mechanism should be included with the product.</p>

<p>Also, when grilling, smoke seems to gather under the cover and pour out of the bottom making the meat very difficult to see.  The heat generated by the grill also seems to be a problem, as the cover has melted slightly in places.  I'm wondering if some venting might help, or if you sell a more durable version of this grill cover.</p>

<p>Are the problems I've described common with this product, or am I simply grilling at a higher temperature than recommended?</p>

      <p>Dear Pilsbury,</p>

<p>I have to question the validity of a certain Pop Tarts commercial I just saw. In this particular commercial a seemingly caring mother gives her son a pop tart while pushing him out the door for school. When he meets up with his other friend, he is given a pilsbury toaster strudel and seems thankful. The other friend asks the boy "So, where do you put all those pop tarts?". The boy then pulls a garage door opener out of his pocket and pushes the button. The garage door opens and reveals a mountain of Pop Tarts spilling out of the garage.</p>

<p>First, what kind of mother gives their boy a Pop Tart for breakfast? Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and a tiny goo filled pasty does not constitute a complete breakfast.</p>

<p>Also, is that boy ready to handle the responsibility of carrying a garage door opener around? If he loses it he gives anyone access to the house. That is a very big risk that mother is taking.  Also, how did the parents not notice the pop tarts piling up in the garage?  With that sort of lack of attention, I can't imagine what else they haven't noticed.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,<br/>
Linda B Wilson</p>

      <p>Dear Subway,</p>

<p>Last month I purchased what I believed to be a 6 inch veggie sub. When I got home, I measured it, and it wasn't quite 6 inches. Was this just a mistake during my visit, or are they all not quite 6 inches? I just don't want people to get shorted a single millimeter of your delicious sandwiches.</p>

<p>Also, I would like information on opening my own Subway location.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,<br/>
Linda B. Wilson</p>

      <p>Dear Mr. Pepsi,</p>

<p>After a long hot day, I recently sat down to enjoy a crystal clear pepsi. However, upon tasting it I was shocked to find it was almost completely flat and had a funny flavor I can not describe. I know they're not SUPPOSED to taste like this which make me think the 12 pack I purchased is defective. I already tried taking it back to the store but they
informed me that they don't carry the product anymore. How do I go about getting a replacement?</p>
