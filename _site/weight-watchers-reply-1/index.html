<p>Dear Renatta,</p>

<p>I have not been able to attend a meeting in person yet, as the closest Weight Watchers meeting location is 15 miles away, and my car has been acting up lately, so I haven't been able to drive further than a few miles away from my home. I hope to attend a meeting as soon as I have time to take my car over to my long time mechanic, Lyle Christiansen, for its regular service.</p>

<p>I'm interested in using the internet for support if possible, but I'm not quite sure which message board to post my question regarding the predicament I described. "What I Ate Today" seemed like a good choice, but now that some time is passed since the incident, writing about what I ate a week ago doesn't seem appropriate.  Do you have suggestions for the best forum to handle such a question?</p>

<p>Thank you,
Linda Wilson</p>
