Thank you for your eMail.

Please be advised that this putty IS NOT the silly putty of yesteryear. It is an epoxy used to glue things together. It is not intended to be used by a child. If it dries to something it will not come off.

You'll need to return it to the store where you purchased it.

Sincerely,  
Customer Service
Plymouth Direct
