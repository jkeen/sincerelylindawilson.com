<p>Dear Glad,</p>

<p>Recently my family and I organized a neighborhood cleanup after our neighborâ€™s house was vandalized by a local gang. We chose to use your Force Flex bags to gather up the debris because of the highly-acclaimed â€œpuncture protectionâ€ your brand offers, while other brands do not.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the shards of broken glass and several boards with nails were no match for these bags. I was disappointed and embarrassed that the bags I publicly supported broke and spilled their contents in front of all my neighbors.</p>

<p>I was wondering if the bags I purchased are defective, or if Iâ€™m using them incorrectly? Should I have double bagged? Do you have a product that is designed to withstand greater force?</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Linda B. Wilson</p>
