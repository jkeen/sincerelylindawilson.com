Dear Weight Watchers,

I've been a member for a few months now, and it's been really helpful having the support and tools to help me control my weight.  I have a couple of questions I'm hoping someone can answer, though.

Last Wednesday was my birthday, and a few friends and I went out to a local pizza parlor to celebrate.  I ate several slices of pizza, making sure to track my points. I indulged, and had about 20 points worth of pizza, causing me to have to dip into my flex points.  Later that night I didn't feel well, and eventually threw up my dinner.

How does this affect my points?  Do I get those 20 points back? Does it depend on how much I threw up?  Because if so, I threw up about 1 and 3/4 cups.
