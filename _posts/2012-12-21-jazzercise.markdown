Dear Jazzercise,

I've gained some weight recently since I started trying to save money
and buy food in bulk though Sam's Club. While those bulk packages of
bagel bites and half-gallon tubs of creme cheese are a great value,
it's a lot to eat!

After I turned 40 a couple of weeks ago, I decided I needed to shed
some pounds, so I started looking for ways to get some rigorous
exercise in a sustainable and fun way. My friend Mary Inskeep
recommended Jazzercise, because she knows I'm a music fan.

I recently attended one of your workout courses, and while I found the
exercise rigorous enough for my liking, I was extremely disappointed
in the lack of real jazz music that was played. I was expecting hits
by Yanni, Kenny G, Zamfir, and Enya, but was instead forced to listen
to songs that reminded me of the time I was looking for an art show
and accidentally wandered into Studio 54.

Do you offer any classes where actual authentic jazz music is played?

Thank you,
Linda Wilson
