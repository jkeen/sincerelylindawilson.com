We apologize if our response was delayed. This is a busy time of year for us and our e-mail volume is very high. We appreciate your patience during this busy time.

Dear Linda,
Thank you for contacting WeightWatchers.com.

The Customer Service Team is here primarily to provide technical support for subscribers to Weight Watchers Online Products. We are, however, also available to answer general questions about Weight Watchers Meetings and other services. Unfortunately, we do not have the proper experience to answer your weight-loss question. 

In our long history, we've found that the best support for people in need of assistance with weight loss can be found at Weight Watchers Meetings. To locate a Meeting near you, please use the Meeting Finder on our site. (Please note that the cost of attending meetings is not included in a subscription to Weight Watchers Online.) 

In addition, the Community section of our site allows you to correspond with other people who are using Weight Watchers to help them lose weight. It's a great place for tip sharing and inspiration.

Sincerely,   
Renata  
Customer Service Associate
