<p>Linda,
I must assume that you are kidding.  Did you read my message to you?  There are many ways that a person can get sick and have the symptoms that your son had.  If, after reading all of the potential reasons, including your son carefully reading the manual and taking all precautions, you still truly believe that the filter may be to blame, I offered to perhaps test the filter.  There is no scenario where we will fly your son to Switzerland.</p>

<p>In fact, before proceeding, weâ€™ll need to talk to your son to learn more.  Also, we would need to learn what a doctor said and review test results since with this serious situation, we assume that you had him tested by a doctor.</p>

<p>The next step is to review the results that you received from a doctor before we proceed. And, if we proceed in any way, it would involve returning your Hiker to us for careful examination and potential testing.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Alan Lizee</p>
