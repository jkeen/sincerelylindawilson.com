<p>Dear Pilsbury,</p>

<p>I have to question the validity of a certain Pop Tarts commercial I just saw. In this particular commercial a seemingly caring mother gives her son a pop tart while pushing him out the door for school. When he meets up with his other friend, he is given a pilsbury toaster strudel and seems thankful. The other friend asks the boy "So, where do you put all those pop tarts?". The boy then pulls a garage door opener out of his pocket and pushes the button. The garage door opens and reveals a mountain of Pop Tarts spilling out of the garage.</p>

<p>First, what kind of mother gives their boy a Pop Tart for breakfast? Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and a tiny goo filled pasty does not constitute a complete breakfast.</p>

<p>Also, is that boy ready to handle the responsibility of carrying a garage door opener around? If he loses it he gives anyone access to the house. That is a very big risk that mother is taking.  Also, how did the parents not notice the pop tarts piling up in the garage?  With that sort of lack of attention, I can't imagine what else they haven't noticed.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,<br/>
