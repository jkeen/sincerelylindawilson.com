Dear Tostitos,

I recently purchased a bag of your "Scoops" tortilla chips, and was disappointed at how easily they break while scooping.  I have tried several different brands of ice cream with no luck -- the chips simply will not scoop satisfactorily.  Would you recommend a different product for this purpose, or do you think the problem is with the ice cream I'm using?  I have found that letting the ice cream melt for a little while improves matters, but I have yet to be fully satisfied.  I am hoping you sell a stronger chip, that would better suit my needs. 

Thank you,
Linda Wilson

P.S.  I would try using frozen yogurt, but my daughter is allergic.
