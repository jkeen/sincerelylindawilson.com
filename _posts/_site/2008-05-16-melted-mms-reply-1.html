<p>Dear M&amp;Ms,</p>

<p>Thank you for your speedy response, but I fear that you have misunderstood my problem. The M&amp;Ms in question were not in my hand at the time, but in my back pocket.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the candy shell melted, either, it just cracked and let the melted chocolate ooze out, staining my favorite pair of desert survival pants.</p>

<p>While I now see that your melting guarantee doesn&#8217;t cover the candies while not in hands or mouths, I&#8217;m concerned that other customers might make the same mistake, causing them to have an unfortunate experience similar to mine.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to put a warning on future bags of M&amp;Ms warning customers that severe melting could occur if kept in pants pockets for extended periods of time?</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />Linda B. Wilson</p>

<p>P.S. Do Peanut M&amp;Ms suffer from the same problems as the plain variety?</p>
