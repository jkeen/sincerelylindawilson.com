            <p>Dear Katadyn,</p>

<p>I have recently become concerned over the impurities in public drinking water, and did research on the most environmentally friendly microfilter I could use to protect my children from bacterial dangers. I recently purchased one of your Hiker model Katadyn microfilters and was very excited to start being more environmentally conscious, while at the same time enjoying natural and pure water.</p>

<p>My youngest son, Aaron, went on a class field trip to the stockyards in Milwaukee last week, and I sent him off with our new water filter in his lunch sack, along with a sandwich and a fruit rollup. During the lunch break, Aaron found some water that had collected on the ground, and filtered it using the water filter. To my astonishment, he became violently ill later that night, and was so sick the next day that he missed the Science Fair. Aaron was very upset, because he had worked awfully hard on his project on bacterial growth, and no one got to see the bacterial colonies that he grew from a culture.</p>

<p>Is it possible that we received a contaminated outlet hose from the factory? I noticed on the unit that it said "made in Sweden", and I have a Swedish friend who never washes her hands after using the lavatory. Have your other customers had similar problems with this unit?</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Linda B. Wilson</p>

            <p>Linda,</p>

<p>Your inquiry is important and I hope that your son is doing better.  It’s unfortunate that this coincided with the Science Fair that was so important to him.</p>

<p>To answer your questions, each Katadyn Hiker is tested at the factory prior to shipment.  While I guess it is possible that a contamination could occur in an outlet hose, we have not seen this in 10+ years of Hiker production.  We very rarely hear of people getting sick but when we ask return questions, our experience has been that the illness seems to come from other causes.  Following are some questions that we ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>Was he tested by a Doctor?  This will often point the cause in a right direction.</li>
<li>Did he sanitize his hands carefully after using the bathroom?</li>
<li>Did any untreated water touch his hands, lips or edge of water container?  This would especially be true in ground water in a stocklyard.</li>
<li>Was the output hose ever in contact with contaminated water?</li>
<li>In his case, did anyone else get sick during this field trip?</li>
</ul>


<p>Our intent is not to pass any blame but to identify that there are many ways that people can get sick.  For people who camp, for example, it is common thought that far more people get sick from unsanitary conditions (not washing hands) than bad food or water.</p>

<p>Another comment - hopefully, your son read the product instructions carefully and, as they suggest, used it at home before using it in the field.  Especially when potentially contaminated water from a puddle at a stockyard.  While these products can do great things, they typically are used in rivers, lakes etc.  In unusually challenging conditions, the instructions say that it is always prudent to use a purification tablet in addition to a filter of any brand.  No water filter will remove all viruses, for example.</p>

<p>On a separate note, I’m curious about the made in Sweden question.  Our products are not produced in Sweden.  All Katadyn Hikers are made in Switzerland.</p>

<p>We will replace your Hiker if you want.  If you still believe that the filter may be the cause, we can communicate further and perhaps agree to send it back to Switzerland and have it tested in our laboratory.</p>

<p>Anyway, again my condolences to your son.  Please let me know how you would like us to proceed.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Alan Lizee<br/>
Chairman<br/>
Katadyn North America</p>
