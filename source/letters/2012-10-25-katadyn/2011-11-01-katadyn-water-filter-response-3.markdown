Linda,  
 
I think that we should resolve this issue.  I initially asked a variety of questions about potential ways that your son may have become sick after drinking water from a puddle in an animal stockyard.  The most important question was if he carefully read the instructions, especially the part of how to use the filter.  Then, depending on the situation, we would perhaps return the unit to Switzerland for testing.  You did not answer any of the questions and interpreted my letter as an offer to fly your family to Switzerland, perhaps in a private jet.  You say that you already started packing and learning the language.  Our communication gap is great.
 
Please return your filter to the address below.  Enclose the receipt from your purchase and we will pay you a full refund.  At that time, we’ll decide if we think that your filter warrants further microbiological testing.  If you provide your address, we’ll send a prepaid UPS shipping label so you do not incur any shipping costs.
 
Sincerely,  
Alan Lizee
