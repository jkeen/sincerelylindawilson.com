<p>Dear Weight Watchers,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a member for a few months now, and it&#8217;s been really helpful having the support and tools to help me control my weight. I have a couple of questions I&#8217;m hoping someone can answer, though.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday was my birthday, and a few friends and I went out to a local pizza parlor to celebrate. I ate several slices of pizza, making sure to track my points. I indulged, and had about 20 points worth of pizza, causing me to have to dip into my flex points. Later that night I didn&#8217;t feel well, and eventually threw up my dinner.</p>

<p>How does this affect my points? Do I get those 20 points back? Does it depend on how much I threw up? Because if so, I threw up about 1 and 3/4 cups.</p>
