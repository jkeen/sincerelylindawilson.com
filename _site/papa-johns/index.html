<p>Dear Mr. John</p>

<p>I'm writing to you concerning one of your advertisements I saw. You advertised your Volcano Pizza, which sounded very good to me. I decided to pick one on my way home from the Minneapolis area. When I ordered, your employees laughed like I was telling a joke. When it was clear that I was not laughing with them, they rudely told me they don't offer that pizza at this location. I left a bit distraught, as I didn't know what I'd tell my family. They were all looking forward to trying this "Volcano Pizza" we had heard so much about. Please let me know where or when I will be able to purchase this product.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,<br/>
Linda Wilson</p>
