<p>Dear Polish Nail Spa,</p>

<p>My family is hosting a foreign exchange student from Poland for the next few months, and I&#8217;m looking for things for her to do in town that might make her feel more at home. What types of services you offer that might suit a Polish customer? Do you serve any Polish themed foods during nail care, or play any Polish music?</p>

<p>Thank you,<br />Linda B. Wilson</p>
