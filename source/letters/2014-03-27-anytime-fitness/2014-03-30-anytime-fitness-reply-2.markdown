What a beautiful morning it was for a jog around the lake! Still a little cold, but Mary and I endured. Since I hadn't heard from you, we only waited for 20 minutes at the Yacht club while we did some extra stretches. I tried calling your office, but you weren't there so I wasn't sure if you were on your way.

Mary was disappointed she missed youâ€”she has lots of questions too! When is a good time for you to meet up?

P.S. One of my ankles is swollen after today's run, should I heat it or ice it? It was a cold morning.
