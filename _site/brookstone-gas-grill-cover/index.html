<p>Dear Brookstone,</p>

<p>I recently purchased your <a href="http://www.brookstone.com/store/product.asp?product_code=356931&wid=18&cid=1803&sid=180303&search_type=subcategory&prodtemp=t1">Rectangular Gas Grill Cover</a> to protect my new Weber grill, and while I am pleased with the overall look of the cover, I have had some trouble using it while grilling.  Although it fits snugly when the grill is closed, opening the grill is difficult while the cover is in place.  I managed to prevent it from slipping by fastening it more securely to the grill with some duct tape, but I do feel a better attachment mechanism should be included with the product.</p>

<p>Also, when grilling, smoke seems to gather under the cover and pour out of the bottom making the meat very difficult to see.  The heat generated by the grill also seems to be a problem, as the cover has melted slightly in places.  I'm wondering if some venting might help, or if you sell a more durable version of this grill cover.</p>

<p>Are the problems I've described common with this product, or am I simply grilling at a higher temperature than recommended?</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Linda Wilson</p>
