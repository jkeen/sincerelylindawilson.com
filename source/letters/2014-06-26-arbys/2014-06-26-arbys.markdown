Dear Arby's,

I recently saw your commercial advertising your "13-Hour Brisket", and am very interested in trying it. My husband and I are huge fans of authentic BBQ (we get the McRib whenever it's available!) so I am quite excited to try this brisket I've heard so much about.

However, I have some questions regarding the ordeirng process. Do I need to call in my order beforehand, or can I still use the drive thru? Is there a way to get the brisket immediately, or at least take some curly fries to-go while it's being smoked? 13 hours is a long time to wait for lunch.

Sincerely,  
Linda B. Wilson

P.S. Can I bring my daughter Denise in to watch the brisket getting smoked? She loves cooking.
