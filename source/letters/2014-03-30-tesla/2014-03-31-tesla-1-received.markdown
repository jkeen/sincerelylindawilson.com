Hi Linda,

Have you been in to see a Model S? If not, I would be happy to schedule a test drive and we can go over all of your questions

The Model S will go 300 miles and simply needs to be plugged into an outlet in your garage - you'll never need to go to a gas station again!

We have SuperChagers along the way to Milwakuee at which you can charge for free - so you'll have to find a more fun way to spend your gas money. :)

We are located in Eden Prairie - where are you? Feel free to give my line a call to setup a time to drive!

Ashley
