Thank you Ashley! I can come in early next week.

Can you offer any sort of entertainment for my two children while I consider cars? Aaron is 8 and Denise is 6, so a playscape, an xbox, some soda or popcorn, and/or a subscription to a magazine like Sports Illustrated for Kids or American Girl would be great for Aaron.

Denise isn't as fussyâ€”if you've just got some counters that need dusting, she can amuse herself for an hour.
