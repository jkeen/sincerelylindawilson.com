Dear Tempur-Pedic,

I recently saw your commercial advertising your pressure relieving mattresses. In the commercial, the man explained that on your mattress you can place a glass of red wine and jump on the bed without spilling the wine. You then suggested "try THAT on your metal spring mattress". I did as the commercial suggested and was very disappointed in the results. The wine spilled and permanently stained my bed! I was wondering if your company would be willing to offer some sort of compensation or discount on one of your spill resistant mattresses to remedy this unfortunate situation.

Sincerely,    
Linda B. Wilson
