Dear Subway,

Last month I purchased what I believed to be a 6 inch veggie sub. When I got home, I measured it, and it wasn't quite 6 inches. Was this just a mistake during my visit, or are they all not quite 6 inches? I just don't want people to get shorted a single millimeter of your delicious sandwiches.

Also, I would like information on opening my own Subway location.

Thanks for your time,  
Linda B. Wilson
