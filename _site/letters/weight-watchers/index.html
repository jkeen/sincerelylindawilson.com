            <p>Dear Weight Watchers,</p>

<p>I've been a member for a few months now, and it's been really helpful having the support and tools to help me control my weight.  I have a couple of questions I'm hoping someone can answer, though.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday was my birthday, and a few friends and I went out to a local pizza parlor to celebrate.  I ate several slices of pizza, making sure to track my points. I indulged, and had about 20 points worth of pizza, causing me to have to dip into my flex points.  Later that night I didn't feel well, and eventually threw up my dinner.</p>

<p>How does this affect my points?  Do I get those 20 points back? Does it depend on how much I threw up?  Because if so, I threw up about 1 and 3/4 cups.</p>

<p>Linda Wilson</p>

            <p>We apologize if our response was delayed. This is a busy time of year for us and our e-mail volume is very high. We appreciate your patience during this busy time.</p>

<p>Dear Linda,
Thank you for contacting WeightWatchers.com.</p>

<p>The Customer Service Team is here primarily to provide technical support for subscribers to Weight Watchers Online Products. We are, however, also available to answer general questions about Weight Watchers Meetings and other services. Unfortunately, we do not have the proper experience to answer your weight-loss question.</p>

<p>In our long history, we've found that the best support for people in need of assistance with weight loss can be found at Weight Watchers Meetings. To locate a Meeting near you, please use the Meeting Finder on our site. (Please note that the cost of attending meetings is not included in a subscription to Weight Watchers Online.)</p>

<p>In addition, the Community section of our site allows you to correspond with other people who are using Weight Watchers to help them lose weight. It's a great place for tip sharing and inspiration.</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br/>
Renata<br/>
Customer Service Associate</p>

            <p>Dear Renatta,</p>

<p>I have not been able to attend a meeting in person yet, as the closest Weight Watchers meeting location is 15 miles away, and my car has been acting up lately, so I haven't been able to drive further than a few miles away from my home. I hope to attend a meeting as soon as I have time to take my car over to my long time mechanic, Lyle Christiansen, for its regular service.</p>

<p>I'm interested in using the internet for support if possible, but I'm not quite sure which message board to post my question regarding the predicament I described. "What I Ate Today" seemed like a good choice, but now that some time is passed since the incident, writing about what I ate a week ago doesn't seem appropriate.  Do you have suggestions for the best forum to handle such a question?</p>

<p>Thank you,<br/>
Linda Wilson</p>

            <p>Dear Kurli,</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.  I thought I was already signed up for Weight Watchers online, but perhaps I am mistaken.  I've been having some trouble with my credit card lately, so I'm wondering if it got declined when signing up, which would explain why you can't find my information. Do you accept Diner's club?  What information do I need to provide you in order to become an online subscriber and get my question answered?</p>

<p>I'm not sure who you are referring to when you said it would best to consult with my Leader. How can I contact them?</p>

<p>Linda Wilson</p>

<p>P.S. Do you have any good recommendations for food scales?  I read on the online forums that having one helps in measuring portion sizes and calculating points.</p>

            <p>Dear Ivonne,</p>

<p>I tried calling yesterday evening, but your offices were closed. How late is customer support open?</p>

<p>I would prefer calling in the evening, as I get free minutes on my phone after 8pm. I would call during the day, but I've used all of my anytime minutes up this month talking to my mother, who is currently battling a nasty virus, and the next time I have free minutes available is when my new billing cycle starts, which is in March.</p>

<p>I would hate to leave this issue unresolved that long, as my son has a birthday party coming up next week, and has requested that we return to that same pizza parlor.</p>
