Dear Applebees,

I’ve been a big fan of your restaurant in Osh Kosh ever since you first opened down the street from my house. I was so excited to finally have a local neighborhood restaurant that was family friendly! My two kids love your appetizer sampler, and my husband loves a good mudslide or two (Chocolate is his weakness!).

On a recent trip back from Minneapolis we were thrilled to discover that you’d expanded and now have a La Crosse location! It was so nice to see a local business doing so well, and also great to get some food just like we’re used to getting back home. We had a great lunch, and Pam was such a nice waitress we made sure to leave her an extra good tip!

However, when doing some bookkeeping today I realized that I accidentally took the “Merchant copy” of the credit card receipt. What is the best way to return this to you? I want to make sure Pam gets the tip we left. Also, do you still have my copy the receipt?

Sincerely,<br/>Linda B. Wilson

P.S. Where do you buy your antiques? I saw a pair of snowshoes on the wall of your restaurant that look a lot like my grandfathers.
