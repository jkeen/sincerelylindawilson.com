<p>Dear Alan,</p>

<p>I think I owe you an apology. I misunderstood your previous email, and assumed Katadyn would be flying my family to Switzerland for testing. I'm embarrassed to admit that I already started packing and learning the language. My daughter was excited to visit IKEA headquarters, too. This news will be disappointing to my whole family.</p>

<p>What kind of questions will you need to ask my son? He is a very curious eight year old, and I'm sure he will be excited to talk to someone from another country.</p>

<p>I understand your need to get more information on this matter, and appreciate your persistence. I referred to my husband's expert diagnosis in a previous email, is there other documentation that he should provide? He could write something up using official university letterhead describing Aaron's symptoms, if that would help.</p>

<p>Again, I'm so sorry about the travel misunderstanding. Or as the Swedish say, SÃ¥ lessen!</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Linda B. Wilson</p>
