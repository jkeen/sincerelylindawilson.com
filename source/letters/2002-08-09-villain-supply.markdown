Dear Mr. Villian,

I'm writing you concerning a certain product advertised on your website.
The product in question is:

<blockquote><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020802142904/http://www.villainsupply.com/traps.html">ULTRA-BUDGET MAN TRAP</a>

Evil On A Budget, Inc. presents the Ultra-Budget Man Trap Kit. Just
dig a hole*, place these sharpened spikes in the bottom, and cover the hole
with loose branches. You have a deadly trap in just minutes!

Price: US$29.49 (Save 20%!)
* hole not included
</blockquote>

The hole isn't included?? For $29.49, I would think the hole must be included. Now I have to pay $29.49 for a product with no hole, and I have to make a separate purchase for a shovel.

I think this product should be re-evaluated.

Thank you for your time,  
Linda B. Wilson
