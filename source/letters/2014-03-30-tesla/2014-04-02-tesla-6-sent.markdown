Are the Crayons Crayola brand? Aaron has been known to eat Crayolas if unattended, so please be aware of that. Off brands he doesn't seem to like the flavor of as much.

But you're right, it might be easier if we just take them with us on the drive. Does the test drive car have a DVD player? I can bring along "Alvin and the Chipmunks: the Squeakquel" if so.

I will get back to you on dates that work for me as soon as my husband gets back from the Osh Kosh farmers market. I left my calendar in the car.
