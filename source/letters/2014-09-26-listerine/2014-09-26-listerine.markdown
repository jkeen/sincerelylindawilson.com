Dear Listerine Zero,

I was very excited to see that you’ve come out with a variety of Listerine without all those calories, while still maintaining a great flavor. As someone who counts calories and watches her weight, I’ve found that every little bit counts. Now I’m able to have as much delicious Listerine as I want, guilt free! Also, fewer upset stomachs with this new variety! Many compliments on the new great product!

I’m interested in the additional ingredients of Listerine Zero, but couldn’t seem to find them on the bottle I purchased. Where can I find the nutrition facts for the Fresh Mint variety of your product? Particularly, I'm interested in the sweeteners used, and the suggested serving size for adults and children.

Thank you,   
Linda Wilson
