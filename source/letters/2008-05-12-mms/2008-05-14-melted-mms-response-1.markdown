Thank you for your email.

Our advertising slogan actually reads; "THE MILK CHOCOLATE MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH-NOT IN YOUR HANDS."  The objective of our advertising is to acquaint consumers with the fact that the candies are neat to eat under average conditions because they have a thin sugar shell protecting the chocolate centers.

We believe that the "melting" you described pertains to the sugar shell coating of the candies. Sometimes the pure food colors will rub off when they come in contact with moisture in the hands -- especially if the candy is held for a while.

Have a great day!
