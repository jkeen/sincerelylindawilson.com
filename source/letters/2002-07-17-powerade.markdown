Dear Mr. or Ms. Powerade,

I am writing you in concern of urination problems associated with Powerade. I recently purchased your 32. oz fruit punch, and I went to the bathroom many times because of it. I was not drinking any other beverage at the time. Is this normal? Also, I question the validity of a woman drinking powerade and then jumping over a bridge. I find that it is not possible to do, and I'm fearful for the people who are trying it.

Thank you for your time and God bless,  
Linda B. Wilson
