<p>Dear Kurli,</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.  I thought I was already signed up for Weight Watchers online, but perhaps I am mistaken.  I've been having some trouble with my credit card lately, so I'm wondering if it got declined when signing up, which would explain why you can't find my information. Do you accept Diner's club?  What information do I need to provide you in order to become an online subscriber and get my question answered?</p>

<p>I'm not sure who you are referring to when you said it would best to consult with my Leader. How can I contact them?</p>

<p>P.S. Do you have any good recommendations for food scales?  I read on the online forums that having one helps in measuring portion sizes and calculating points.</p>
