Dear Alan,

Thank you so much for your reply.

Aaron is doing much better. There were a couple of days where things weren't looking good, but his color is finally returning, and he's regaining some of his appetite. 

When Aaron first fell ill, my husband (who is a doctor) found a substitute teacher to teach his Intro To Biology class so he could take care of Aaron. He seemed to think his illness had something to do with some bacteria that the filter didn't catch, if that helps.

I really appreciate your willingness to try and get to the bottom of this situation. When is a good time for us to fly into Switzerland to get Aaron examined in your laboratory? Does Katadyn have private jets, or will we be flying with one of the major airlines?

What kind of tests will need to be run? If his symptoms subside before our flight, is that all right? I'll be in Milwaukee in a few days for work, and I could stop by the stockyards and collect some more water, if that would help. 

Sincerely,  
Linda B. Wilson
