<p>Maricar,</p>

<p>Oh dear, am I already in trouble?  I do not want to provide my account information, as I fear that you may suspend it due to my recent actions.  I did not intend to steal from Blockbuster, and hope we can resolve this matter without involving the authorities.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to continue being a valued Blockbuster customer?  How much additional money do I need to pay in order to own "Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"?  Hopefully after purchasing the movie in full, we can consider this matter resolved.</p>
