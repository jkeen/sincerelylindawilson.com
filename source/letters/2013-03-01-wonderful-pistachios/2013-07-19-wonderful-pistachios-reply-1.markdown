Hello again. Pistachios were on sale at my local Kroger grocery store,
so I bought another package and the same thing happened! I found two
delicious pistachios without the nut meat inside the shell.

Also I still have not received the coupon for my previously defective
bag as promised.

Also, would it be possible to take a tour of your pistachio farm? My
son loves to play with farm animals.

Sincerely,<br/>
Linda Wilson
