Dear Stephanie, 

Thank you for you response.  I am interested in finding a more appropriate game for my son to play, but am concerned that "Clue Carnival: The Case Of The Missing Prizes" might encourage stealing, as the original clue seems to have encouraged some violent tendencies in my young son.

Recently he started playing an incredibly violent game on his Wii called "Chicken Shooter", which features execution-style slaughterings of innocent animals. To make matters worse, I found a dead chicken in our chicken coop yesterday, and I can't help but suspect Aaron. Is this normal?

I appreciate the offer to exchange my copy of Clue.  Do you think the game could be modified in the next two years to be more appropriate for younger children?  If not, I may as well keep my current copy and only bring it out again when Aaron is at an appropriate age to handle the mature content.

Sincerely,    
Linda Wilson

P.S. Would you please forward my original email to your game developers?  I believe there is some value in the surprise party version of Clue I described.  I started creating my own version at home, but have had trouble finding a miniature kazoo for one of the game pieces. Perhaps your developers might be able to suggest an appropriate place to purchase such things.
