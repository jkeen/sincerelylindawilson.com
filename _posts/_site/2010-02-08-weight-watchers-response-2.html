<p>Dear Linda,</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting us with your inquiry. As we stated in our previous email, the online Customer Service Team is here primarily to provide technical support to Weight WatchersÂ® Online subscribers and to answer general questions about meetings and other services. We do not have the proper experience to address your specific weight loss questions. Therefore, it would be best to consult with your Leader regarding any concerns you may have after you join Weight Watchers.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />Kurli Customer Service Associate<br />Weight Watchers International, Inc.</p>
