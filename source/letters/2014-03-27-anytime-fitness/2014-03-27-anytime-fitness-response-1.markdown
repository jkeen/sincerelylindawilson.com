Hi Linda!

Wow! It sounds like you've had quite the experience here at Anytime Fitness and I'd love nothing better than to sit down and hear more about it! When do you usually work out? I'll do my best to be here to talk with you during your next workout so I can help with training options that will get you back to your fantastic college figure.

Thanks for the email Linda, and I'll see what I can find as far as muscle milk by the gallon!
