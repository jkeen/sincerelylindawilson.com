Hello Patricia,

I'm a little shocked at your response. I have been using Listerine for years, and this is the first I've heard of it being untested! 

Does Walgreens know this? They are running a great special on Listerine right now, and I doubt they would promote an untested product. Should I switch to Walgreens brand mouthwash? I don't like their flavors as much as yours, but I would hate for Listerine to negatively affect my family's health due to lack of testing. 

I really hope you can verify that this product is safe, because I just bought four bottles of the Clean Mint Listerine zero for my husband and I, and two of the Original Orange Juice Listerine for my son Aaron and my daughter Denise. They LOVE it in the morning! It gets them riled up and ready to go, and I would hate to give that up. I think my son is your biggest fan! I am laughing out loud right now!

Thank you for sharing my email with the other team members, I would love to talk to them on the phone, but I'm currently suffering from a bit of laryngitis.

Sincerely,   
Linda B. Wilson

P.S. Are there plans to make a zero-calorie version of the Orange Juice Listerine? My son is getting a little pudgy.
