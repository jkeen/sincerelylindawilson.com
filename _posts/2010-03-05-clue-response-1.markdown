Dear Linda,

Thank you for contacting us regarding Hasbro's Clue game. We appreciate your taking the time to bring this matter to our attention. 

Hasbro, Inc. prides itself on its excellent reputation, based on years of experience in planning, designing and constructing safe, dependable and age appropriate products. We do count on parents such as you to help us maintain the high standards we keep for parents and their children. 

As you alluded to, the Clue game is age coded 8 and up and our recommendation is that 8 plus children play. We do manufacture a Clue game that is ages 5 and up. This game is Clue Carnival: The Case of the Missing Prizes. Please visit our web site to see this game, as well as, other games that are appropriate for your child's age.

For your convenience, we will be sending a postage paid label to assist you in returning the Clue game to us. Our postage paid labels are valid for four weeks from the date of the letter. As soon as we receive the game, we will forward it to our Quality Assurance team for further evaluation, and a replacement product of comparable value will be sent. Due to your concern, in the meantime, please discontinue use of the game.

Please call us at 1(888) 836-7025 if we can be of further assistance. 

Again, thank you for contacting us.
