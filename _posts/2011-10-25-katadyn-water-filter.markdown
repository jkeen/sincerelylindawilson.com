Dear Katadyn,

I have recently become concerned over the impurities in public drinking water, and did research on the most environmentally friendly microfilter I could use to protect my children from bacterial dangers. I recently purchased one of your Hiker model Katadyn microfilters and was very excited to start being more environmentally conscious, while at the same time enjoying natural and pure water. 

My youngest son, Aaron, went on a class field trip to the stockyards in Milwaukee last week, and I sent him off with our new water filter in his lunch sack, along with a sandwich and a fruit rollup. During the lunch break, Aaron found some water that had collected on the ground, and filtered it using the water filter. To my astonishment, he became violently ill later that night, and was so sick the next day that he missed the Science Fair. Aaron was very upset, because he had worked awfully hard on his project on bacterial growth, and no one got to see the bacterial colonies that he grew from a culture.

Is it possible that we received a contaminated outlet hose from the factory? I noticed on the unit that it said "made in Sweden", and I have a Swedish friend who never washes her hands after using the lavatory. Have your other customers had similar problems with this unit?

Sincerely,  
Linda B. Wilson
