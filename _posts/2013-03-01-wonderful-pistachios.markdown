Dear Wonderful Pistachios,

I keep finding empty shells in my bags of delicious pistachios. Did I receive a defective package? If so, how do I go about applying for a refund? I've already eaten the pistachios containing nuts.

Also, removing the shells is so time consuming. Do you sell a version of these nuts that's easier to eat?

Sincerely,<br/>
Linda Wilson
