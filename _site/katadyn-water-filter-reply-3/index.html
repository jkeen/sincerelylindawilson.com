<p>Dear Alan,</p>

<p>Last night at dinner, Aaron was talking about his field trip, and I was asking him questions in order to make sure that his illness was caused by a faulty water filter. Apparently on the bus ride home that afternoon, some of his classmates found a package of spoiled hot dogs on the floor, and dared Aaron to eat some.</p>

<p>Aaron refused at first, as we're Jewish and he knows that pork products are not allowed. But when the other children triple-dog-dared Aaron to eat some hot dogs, he could not resist. This might be the actual cause for his illness.</p>

<p>That is the least of our worries right now, though, as Rabbi Hershkop has banned us from Temple service this week. He claims Aaron's spirit has been tainted!</p>

<p>I am extremely embarrassed to have wasted your time with this matter, and I appreciate your patience. Aaron is very sorry for lying, and will be punished.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Linda Wilson</p>

<p>P.S. If anyone in your US office is moving to your headquarters in Switzerland and wants to learn Swedish, I have a copy of Rosetta Stone's "Learn Swedish" software that I won't be needing anymore.</p>
