Dear Ms. Wilson,

Thank you for your email.

We apologize you have experienced problems using your grill cover. The cover is intended to be used ONLY while you are not grilling. The intentions are for it to protect your grill from the weather elements. Please make sure you take the grill cover off when you plan on grilling to avoid further damage to your cover.

Please let us know if we may be of further assistance.

Sincerely,  
Elisha
