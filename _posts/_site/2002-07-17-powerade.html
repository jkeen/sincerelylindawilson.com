<p>Dear Mr. or Ms. Powerade,</p>

<p>I am writing you in concern of urination problems associated with Powerade. I recently purchased your 32. oz fruit punch, and I went to the bathroom many times because of it. I was not drinking any other beverage at the time. Is this normal? Also, I question the validity of a woman drinking powerade and then jumping over a bridge. I find that it is not possible to do, and I&#8217;m fearful for the people who are trying it.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and God bless,<br />Linda B. Wilson</p>
