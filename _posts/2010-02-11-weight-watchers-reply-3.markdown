Dear Ivonne,

I tried calling yesterday evening, but your offices were closed. How late is customer support open? 

I would prefer calling in the evening, as I get free minutes on my phone after 8pm. I would call during the day, but I've used all of my anytime minutes up this month talking to my mother, who is currently battling a nasty virus, and the next time I have free minutes available is when my new billing cycle starts, which is in March. 

I would hate to leave this issue unresolved that long, as my son has a birthday party coming up next week, and has requested that we return to that same pizza parlor.
