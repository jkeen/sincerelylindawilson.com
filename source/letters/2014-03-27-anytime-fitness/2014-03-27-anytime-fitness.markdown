Dear Anytime Fitness,

Over the years I've started to put on a few pounds, so I've started running on the treadmill at your gym. When I was in community college in the late 70s in Osh Kosh, Wisconsin, I used to run on the local cross country team, "The Osh Kosh Community College Cross Country Team", or as we nicknamed it "O Ko Co Co Cro Co"! 

I had just met my future husband, Richard, and he loved my slender physique.

I've come a long way from that body, and I've been trying to return to my college figure, but haven't been having much luck using your equipment! Is there a possibility the treadmill I've been using is defective? I always use the one closest to the bathroom (IBS), and run for 45 minutes almost every day, but haven't been seeing the results I was expecting.

Is this normal?

Sincerely, <br/>
Linda Wilson

P.S. Do you know where I can buy muscle milk by the gallon? The small ones take up so much room in my fridge.
