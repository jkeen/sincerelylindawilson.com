Hi Linda,

I am the General Manager of the ONALASKA WISCONSIN Applebees.  LaCrosse, Wisconsin and Onalaska, Wisconsin, are right next to each other as a highway is the boundary between the two cities.  I have never been to Alaska either.  I do have copies of the credit card receipts but need to know what day and time you were here. If could give me a call or e-mail me a phone number I can call you back and we can discuss what options there are. The store phone number is 608-555-8570.
 
Thanks,<br/>Chris
