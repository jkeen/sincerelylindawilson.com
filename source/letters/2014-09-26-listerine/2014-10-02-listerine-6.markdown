Hi Paige,

Dr. Roseboom thinks my voice should return by the end of next week. My throat is pretty inflamed, so I've had to stop with the Listerine for now, even though the Listerine Zero is easier to stomach. I'm really eager to hear what your product team comes back with in terms of serving size and proper testing, though, and I think Patricia was handling that. 

Can you please put me back in touch with Patricia?

Sincerely,
Linda Wilson

P.S. Who are Johnson & Johnson? I think you have me confused with someone else!
