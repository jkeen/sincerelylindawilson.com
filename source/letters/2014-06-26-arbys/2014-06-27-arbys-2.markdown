Dear Arby's,

Wow! I didn't realize this 13-hour brisket was a local Osh Kosh special! Are you not offering it at your other locations? 

I was just chatting with my friend Delores last night (who lives in Phoenix) and I was telling her about your new brisket, and she was very excited to try it also! So if you haven't considered it, you might want to offer this item at all your Arby's locations.

I still have some ordering questions regarding the brisket, and am unsure of how to get in contact with the Osh Kosh Arby's location. Do you have contact information for them? I've run out of phone minutes this month, so an email would be preferred. 

Thank you,  
Linda Wilson
