Dear Alan,

Last night at dinner, Aaron was talking about his field trip, and I was asking him questions in order to make sure that his illness was caused by a faulty water filter. Apparently on the bus ride home that afternoon, some of his classmates found a package of spoiled hot dogs on the floor, and dared Aaron to eat some.

Aaron refused at first, as we're Jewish and he knows that pork products are not allowed. But when the other children triple-dog-dared Aaron to eat some hot dogs, he could not resist. This might be the actual cause for his illness. 

That is the least of our worries right now, though, as Rabbi Hershkop has banned us from Temple service this week. He claims Aaron's spirit has been tainted!

I am extremely embarrassed to have wasted your time with this matter, and I appreciate your patience. Aaron is very sorry for lying, and will be punished.

Sincerely,  
Linda Wilson

P.S. If anyone in your US office is moving to your headquarters in Switzerland and wants to learn Swedish, I have a copy of Rosetta Stone's "Learn Swedish" software that I won't be needing anymore.
