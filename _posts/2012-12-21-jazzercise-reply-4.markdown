I think it was the Northwest location, although I'm embarrassed to admit I'm not sureâ€”my husband drove me at the time, we're from out of town, and Richard is a terrible driver so we got lost! I remember it being close to a restaurant, because we got lunch after the session.

And oh dear, I'll have to see if I can digitalize my cassette. I think my son has a machine that can do that.
