<p>Dear Blockbuster,</p>

<p>I recently rented some movies from you over the weekend and saw a disturbing FBI message at the beginning of one of the films: "DVD FOR SALE ONLY".  I do not want to get in trouble with the FBI, as I have had some tax problems in the past, and do not want to press my luck.  What do I need to do to safely resolve this situation?  Can I purchase the film in question from you for the original cost minus the cost of the rental (which I already paid)?  Will that be enough to keep me out of trouble?</p>

<p>Also, are you going to get in trouble from the government for renting a DVD that's clearly meant for sale only, or did you simply mix up DVDs you had for sale and DVDs you had for rent?  For what it's worth, I will not say anything to the FBI about this matter, as I enjoy your video store very much and would not want to see it closed down.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Linda Wilson</p>
