<p>Thank you for your eMail.</p>

<p>Please be advised that this putty IS NOT the silly putty of yesteryear. It is an epoxy used to glue things together. It is not intended to be used by a child. If it dries to something it will not come off.</p>

<p>You'll need to return it to the store where you purchased it.</p>

<p>Sincerely,
Customer Service
Plymouth Direct</p>
