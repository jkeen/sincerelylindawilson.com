<p>Dear Subway,</p>

<p>Last month I purchased what I believed to be a 6 inch veggie sub. When I got home, I measured it, and it wasn't quite 6 inches. Was this just a mistake during my visit, or are they all not quite 6 inches? I just don't want people to get shorted a single millimeter of your delicious sandwiches.</p>

<p>Also, I would like information on opening my own Subway location.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time,</p>

<p>Linda B. Wilson</p>
