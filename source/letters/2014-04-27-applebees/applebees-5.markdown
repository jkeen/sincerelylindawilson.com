How on earth do you manage an Applebees in La Crosse AND an Applebees in Alaska? I used to manage a Country Kitchen in the 80s, and being present was very importantâ€”the one day I missed work the place almost burned down! Anyway, I don't know how you do it! 

I hate to seem rude, Chris, but can I get in touch with somebody local, like Pam? I would really prefer not to make an international call to Alaska. Am I in trouble? It's ok if you can't find my copy of the receipt, I've had some tax trouble in the past, but hopefully the IRS will let this one slide. What's most important to me is making sure Pam gets the tip I left her.
