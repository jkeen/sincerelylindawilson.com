Dear Mrs. Linda Wilson:

Thanks for your email about Wonderful Pistachios.

We're sorry you found our product to be unsatisfactory.  Please accept our sincere apologies.  We feel the satisfaction of our customers is the most important result of our production process.

Paramount Farms has a long history of providing high quality products to consumers. Through numerous inspections and protective measures, we make a product we believe everyone will enjoy.  We strive to ensure product quality and purity from harvesting to packaging. Thank you for taking time to report this matter.

If you'd kindly send us the UPC (universal product code or bar code) from the package along with the lot number found close to the "best by" date, it would be greatly appreciated.  This information will help us complete our report about your experience for the Quality Assurance department.

We will be sending a coupon for a fresh bag.  We hope to regain your confidence in us and our products.

Also, we want to let you know that we do produce shelled pistachios. In case you are unable to find the shelled pistachios, we are providing the UPC number below which will assist your store's produce manager in ordering them for you if the product is available from that storeâ€™s warehouse.
