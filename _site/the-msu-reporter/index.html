<p>Dear Them Sure Porter,</p>

<p>I was searching for someone reliable to carry my bags for my upcoming trip to Branson, Missouri, and came across your web site. However, it seems your site has been "hacked" and taken over by some sort of college newspaper.</p>

<p>I was hoping to hire a good porter, as I will have to move between multiple hotels during my five night stay in Branson.</p>

<p>Do you still offer porter services, or have you shut down?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br/>
Linda Wilson</p>
