<p>Dear Jazzercise,</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gained some weight recently since I started trying to save money and buy food in bulk though Sam&#8217;s Club. While those bulk packages of bagel bites and half-gallon tubs of creme cheese are a great value, it&#8217;s a lot to eat!</p>

<p>After I turned 40 a couple of weeks ago, I decided I needed to shed some pounds, so I started looking for ways to get some rigorous exercise in a sustainable and fun way. My friend Mary Inskeep recommended Jazzercise, because she knows I&#8217;m a music fan.</p>

<p>I recently attended one of your workout courses, and while I found the exercise rigorous enough for my liking, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of real jazz music that was played. I was expecting hits by Yanni, Kenny G, Zamfir, and Enya, but was instead forced to listen to songs that reminded me of the time I was looking for an art show and accidentally wandered into Studio 54.</p>

<p>Do you offer any classes where actual authentic jazz music is played?</p>

<p>Thank you, Linda Wilson</p>
