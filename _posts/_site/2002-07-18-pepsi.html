<p>Dear Mr. Pepsi,</p>

<p>After a long hot day, I recently sat down to enjoy a crystal clear pepsi. However, upon tasting it I was shocked to find it was almost completely flat and had a funny flavor I can not describe. I know they&#8217;re not SUPPOSED to taste like this which make me think the 12 pack I purchased is defective. I already tried taking it back to the store but they informed me that they don&#8217;t carry the product anymore. How do I go about getting a replacement?</p>
