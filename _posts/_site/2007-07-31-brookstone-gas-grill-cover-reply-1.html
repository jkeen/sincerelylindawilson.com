<p>I&#8217;m very disappointed to hear that, but it makes sense now that I think about it. If the cover was designed for use while grilling, it would be able to handle the heat without melting.</p>

<p>I am still interested in protecting my grill while cooking, though. Do you offer a product that has higher tolerance for heat, perhaps with vent holes? I would really like to keep my grill in good condition. It would also be great if that product came in green, like the one I have.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help,<br />Linda B. Wilson</p>
