Hi Linda!

My apologies for missing the run yesterday > I'm sure it was very enjoyable for you both! I'm happy to meet with you both in my office anytime this week > let's make an appointment and bring your questions, some sneakers, and let's get to it so your ankles don't swell up after every run! (By the way, if you have swelling, ice is going to be your best friend > 10-15min on typically does the trick)
Thank you for all your hard work Linda!
