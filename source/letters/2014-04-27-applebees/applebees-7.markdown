Oh my goodness! Chris, that is so funny. I am laughing out loud right now! I had no idea! I can't wait to tell my friends about this at book club on Wednesday. We're actually reading a book about Alaska right now, which might explain why I misunderstood. Have you read Into The Wild? So far it is inspiring!

We were at your restaurant on April 19th around 2pm. I remember because we were rushing home to prepare for our Easter festivities the next day. Aaron and Denise are always excited for the Easter bunny's visit, but honestly I think my husband was more excited than either of them! I told you he loves chocolate! I'm laughing out loud again!

Thanks for looking into this Chris, please say hello to Pam for me.
