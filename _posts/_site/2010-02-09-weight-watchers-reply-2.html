<p>Dear Kurli,</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. I thought I was already signed up for Weight Watchers online, but perhaps I am mistaken. I&#8217;ve been having some trouble with my credit card lately, so I&#8217;m wondering if it got declined when signing up, which would explain why you can&#8217;t find my information. Do you accept Diner&#8217;s club? What information do I need to provide you in order to become an online subscriber and get my question answered?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure who you are referring to when you said it would best to consult with my Leader. How can I contact them?</p>

<p>P.S. Do you have any good recommendations for food scales? I read on the online forums that having one helps in measuring portion sizes and calculating points.</p>
