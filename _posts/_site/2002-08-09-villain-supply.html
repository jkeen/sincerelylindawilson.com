<p>Dear Mr. Villian,</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing you concerning a certain product advertised on your website. The product in question is:</p>
<blockquote><a href='http://web.archive.org/web/20020802142904/http://www.villainsupply.com/traps.html'>ULTRA-BUDGET MAN TRAP</a>

Evil On A Budget, Inc. presents the Ultra-Budget Man Trap Kit. Just
dig a hole*, place these sharpened spikes in the bottom, and cover the hole
with loose branches. You have a deadly trap in just minutes!

Price: US$29.49 (Save 20%!)
* hole not included
</blockquote>
<p>The hole isn&#8217;t included?? For $29.49, I would think the hole must be included. Now I have to pay $29.49 for a product with no hole, and I have to make a separate purchase for a shovel.</p>

<p>I think this product should be re-evaluated.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,<br />Linda B. Wilson</p>
