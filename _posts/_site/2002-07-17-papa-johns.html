<p>Dear Mr. John</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing to you concerning one of your advertisements I saw. You advertised your Volcano Pizza, which sounded very good to me. I decided to pick one on my way home from the Minneapolis area. When I ordered, your employees laughed like I was telling a joke. When it was clear that I was not laughing with them, they rudely told me they don&#8217;t offer that pizza at this location. I left a bit distraught, as I didn&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d tell my family. They were all looking forward to trying this &#8220;Volcano Pizza&#8221; we had heard so much about. Please let me know where or when I will be able to purchase this product.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,<br />Linda Wilson</p>
